This help guide will cover the basics of Diagnosis.

Some important information about the overlay!
The overlay can hang/lag or even vanish, if other apps need the resources desperately, this is preferred though as we do want to prevent Diagnosis to influence other apps. Don't worry, it will fix itself when resources are available again.

Introduction:
Now first things first, if you wish to use the various statistics available within the app you will need to turn database collection on, in order to do this, have a look at the settings.
Please keep in mind this can cause lag on lower end phones and if so you may not want to use this function.
The update interval is how often data is collected (in seconds) and the information overlay is updated. Lower values use more CPU but offer faster updates. A value of 3-5 is usually fine, lower end devices might need to increase this to 9-10 to avoid lag.
The data displayed in the overlay is what will be written to the database too, if you enabled it.

Customization:
The overlay can be customized in various ways, one is what each line displays. Opening the settings you will see an entry called 'Customize lines' containing Line1/2/3/4, these will determine what each line of the overlay displays. There are alot to choose from and probably more to come with each update, just look through them and find your preferred information.

Advanced settings:
You don't really need to change these. The default settings are usually okay.
Update interval is how often Diagnosis will collect data(this will also update overlay),cache size is how much to store into RAM before attempting to write to disk, this defaults at 24, a bigger data density means smaller database file but less accurate information, so with density of 5 and cache at 10 it will cache 10 data sets, condense them into 2 and then write to database.
"Drop database" will delete the database, thus freeing the diskspace, but removing the saved data.
Data age limit lets you specificy an amount of hours for which you want to keep the data, any data older than this will be deleted the next time you start the overlay.\n\n\n\n
